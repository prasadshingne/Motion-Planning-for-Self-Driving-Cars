# Motion-Planning-for-Self-Driving-Cars

This is the final project in Course 4 - Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars Specialization offered by Coursera

Note: According to Coursera's Honor Code none of the solutions can be shared in contrast to Udacity hence I am only sharing the results.

1. brake_output.png - brake actuator normalized to between 0-1 vs time
2. forward_speed.png - vehicle velocity vs time
3. steer_output.png - steering position normalized to between +/- 1 vs time
4. throttle_output.png - throttle position normalized to between 0-1 vs time
5. trajectory.png - vehicle trajectory in X and Y co-ordinates
